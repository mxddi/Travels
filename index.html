         <p align="center">hi, this is a simple html site where I'll post some of my most memorable travel destinations! I have been to several
         <p align="center">different countries, including <em>Peru, Mexico, Italy and Vatican City </em>(a tiny country within Italy). Although I find 
         <p align="center">foreign travel most intriguing, I have had the wonderful opportunity to visit numerous U.S. states, including Hawaii, as well! Travel is
         <p align="center">my dearest passion and I plan to explore as many magical corners of this world as I can during my time here.
