  <p>hi, this is simple html site where I'll post some of my most memorable travel destinations! I have been to several
  <p>different countries, including Peru, Mexico, Italy and Vatican City (a tiny country within Italy). Although I find 
  <p>foreign travel most intriguing, I have had the wonderful opportunity to visit numerous U.S. states, as well! Travel is
  <p>my biggest passion and I plan to explore as many magical corners of this world as I can during my time here.
